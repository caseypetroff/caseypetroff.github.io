title: "About Me"
---

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Political Economy and Government Program at Harvard University with a topical focus on political economy and economic history and a substantive focus on the politics of science. I study how laypeople change their beliefs and behaviors when confronted with new information about the world around them and how governments use science and technology to carry out the goals of the state. 

My research is supported by a Stone PhD Scholarship in Inequality and Wealth Concentration and by the Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences. I can be reached at petroff[at]g.harvard.edu.
