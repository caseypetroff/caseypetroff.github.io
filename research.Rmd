**Making Policy Under Threat and Uncertainty: Evidence from the History of Public Health**

How do policymakers select experts to advise them on technical subjects when they cannot themselves understand the evidence those experts use? This paper examines policymaker-expert relationship using evidence from the early history of public health. It models the fundamental problem of expert-policymaker relations: laypeople cannot directly evaluate the quality of experts’ predictions. Instead, policymakers, and the constituents to which they are accountable, must rely on imperfect signals – experts’ relevant prestige within the broader expert community, and their own ability to translate experts’ advice into outcomes. Even if the fundamental quality of experts’ technical evaluation is sound, bad policy outcomes can cause policymakers to incorrectly update their beliefs about expert quality, affecting their future selection of expert advisors. I use primary evidence from British parliamentary debates and a large database of medical history writing to examine the case of cholera in the 19th century. In the face of this novel public health threat, British policymakers selected the most prestigious members of the medical community to advise them, and, on the basis of these experts’ advice, imposed national and domestic quarantines. However, due to imperfect implementation, the quarantine measures failed to prevent the arrival of infected cases from Europe. The policymakers then switched to a different set of experts, who espoused a different causal model of the disease based on a theory of “miasma” (rather than one of contagion) to address subsequent waves of disease.

**Conflict Technology as a Catalyst of State Formation**

with Michael-David Mangini

The rise of the modern European state coincided with the arrival of a new technology, artillery, that rendered previous urban fortifications obsolete. We examine the role that this shift in offensive-defensive technological capabilities played in reshaping the political landscape of Europe using detailed data on city-level urban defensive investment, the locations of artillery manufacturers, changing locations of national borders, and battle sites. We propose that the gunpowder revolution created a threat of conquest that could only be mitigated at extreme cost. This incentivized the agglomeration of territory into national states with unprecedented political authority in order to better finance the newly necessary expenses of defense and coordinate inter-city security cooperation. We find that after the development of gunpowder technology, new defensive investments were more likely to be located in areas where borders disappeared, closer to politically relevant national borders, and were more likely to be the targets of conflict. These findings highlight the changing strategic significance of cities in an era characterized by the formation of modern nation-states.

**Home Front Experience and Women's Political Activism**

with Elisabeth Perlman

We leverage novel, hand-collected archival data on women's home front volunteering during the American Civil War to demonstrate the link between wartime and peacetime political capacity. Towns that had volunteer organizations for women in support of the Union war effort were more likely to have women-led political movements to agitate for temperance during the 1870s. This relationship is robust to adjusting for other measures of pre-war and wartime social and organizational capital, including men's enlistment in the Civil War. We argue that wartime mobilization can help women gain organizing experience that can be applied to politics even in contexts that do not involve women directly substituting for men's roles (as they did during the first and second World Wars) and in contexts that predate or preclude most roles for women in the public sphere.

**Export Bans and Volatility Expectations in Grain Markets**

with Michael K. Adjemian and and Michel A. Robe

We document that forward-looking grain price uncertainty is boosted by export bans in key producer countries. We measure market uncertainty via option-implied volatilities (IVs). We hand-construct a detailed, daily dataset of all major export restrictions on wheat, corn, and soybeans between 2001 and 2016. We use this granular, country-level information to show that grain IVs are significantly higher on the day and week when a ban is first imposed and also during the whole period when the ban is in effect. Bans’ impacts are statistically and economically significant, with IVs up between 1 and 2 percentage points on the first day of the ban and up almost one half of 1 percentage point during the entire period when it is in effect. Each grain IV is sensitive to export restrictions for that grain and also for other grains. The impact of bans is weaker for soybeans than for corn or wheat. The results hold even when we control for global macroeconomic uncertainty and risk aversion (jointly captured by the VIX), the state of grain inventories (proxied by net costs of carry at the start of the ban), and possible Samuelson (1965) effects. Our results show the importance of taking political risk into account when analyzing forward-looking volatility in U.S. agricultural markets.
