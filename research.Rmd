### **Conflict Technology as a Catalyst of State Formation**

*with Michael-David Mangini*

We argue that the gunpowder revolution in medieval Europe encouraged the amalgamation of smaller polities into larger centralized states. The shock to military technology made existing fortifications obsolete and dramatically raised the cost of defensive investments. Small polities lacked the fiscal capacity to make these investments, so they had either to ally or merge with others. Alliances created prospects of free-riding by interior cities on border cities. In contrast, unitary centralized states benefited from geographic and fiscal economies of scale, facilitating defensive investments at the border that protected the interior while limiting free-riding and resource misallocation. Using a new dataset on fortifications in over 6,000 European cities, we find that states made defensive investments in areas of territorial contestation, closer to borders, and farther from raw building materials. These findings are consistent with the theory that large centralized states arose in part as a consequence of changes in military technology.

### **Expert-Policymaker Interactions: Evidence from the History of Public Health**

I examine the dual roles of experts – on one hand, as scholars responsible to a community of their expert peers, and on the other hand, as interested advisors to policymakers. In this setting, experts must trade off between their professional reputation for scientific accuracy and their ability to shape policy – goals that sometimes conflict, particularly when experts have personal preferences over a contentious policy choice. To explore this duality, I use evidence from public health interventions during 19th-century cholera pandemics in Britain. Drawing on a large, representative corpus of medical publications, I find that experts with links to Britain’s overseas trade sector were less likely than their peers without such political connections to advance theories that cholera was a contagious disease spread by trade and travel. This difference is driven by the early part of the 19th century, when scientific methodologies were primitive and the scientific consensus was weak. I argue that biased experts are more likely to act on their bias in low-information environments, when they can convincingly pool with uninformed actors. As a consensus forms and the quality of scientific evidence improves, they are more likely to reveal information as the pooling strategy becomes less plausible.

### **Home Front Experience and Women's Political Activism**

The 19th century saw the first entry of American women into mass political activity. What originated this sudden influx of female political activists? I leverage novel, hand-collected archival data on women's volunteering during the American Civil War to demonstrate a connection between wartime and peacetime political capacity. Towns where women organized volunteer societies in support of the Union war effort were more likely to have women-led political movements to agitate for temperance, a key issue that mobilized women who previously had little political experience. This relationship is robust to adjusting for other measures of pre-war and wartime social and organizational capital, including male enlistment in the Civil War. I argue that wartime volunteer mobilization helped women gain organizing experience that was useful for mass politics, even in a social context that precluded them from the public sphere and did not involve women directly substituting for male roles (as they did during the first and second World Wars).

### **Export Bans and Volatility Expectations in Grain Markets**

We show the importance of accounting for political risk to understand forward-looking price volatility in agricultural markets. We propose a theoretical model that shows uncertainty about the future world price of staple foods is positively related to the likelihood (and, counterintuitively, is further boosted by the actual imposition) of export bans in top producer countries. To test our model's predictions, we use option-implied volatilities (IVols) as a proxy for commodity market uncertainty. We construct a novel, daily dataset of major restrictions on grain and oilseed exports that were announced, adopted, or repealed in 2002-2019. We show that wheat and corn IVols are significantly higher on the day and the week when a ban is first imposed and also during the whole period when the ban is in effect. The effects of export bans are statistically and economically significant. The results hold even when we control for global macro-economic uncertainty and risk aversion (jointly proxied by the equity VIX) and for cash market tightness (including the state of grain inventories) prior to the ban.
