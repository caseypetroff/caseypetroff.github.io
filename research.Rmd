**Making Policy Under Threat and Uncertainty: Evidence from the History of Public Health**

How do policymakers select experts to advise them on technical subjects when they cannot themselves understand the evidence those experts use? This paper examines policymaker-expert relationship using evidence from the early history of public health. It models the fundamental problem of expert-policymaker relations: laypeople cannot directly evaluate the quality of experts’ predictions. Instead, policymakers, and the constituents to which they are accountable, must rely on imperfect signals – experts’ relevant prestige within the broader expert community, and their own ability to translate experts’ advice into outcomes. Even if the fundamental quality of experts’ technical evaluation is sound, bad policy outcomes can cause policymakers to incorrectly update their beliefs about expert quality, affecting their future selection of expert advisors.

[**Conflict Technology as a Catalyst of State Formation**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4wsi4cm08gb5zdj/walls-draft-winter-2021.pdf?dl=0)

with Michael-David Mangini

We argue that the gunpowder revolution in medieval Europe encouraged the amalgamation of smaller polities into larger centralized states. The shock to military technology made existing fortifications obsolete and dramatically raised the cost of defensive investments. Small polities lacked the fiscal capacity to make these investments, so they had either to ally or merge with others. Alliances created prospects of free-riding by interior cities on border cities. In contrast, unitary centralized states benefited from geographic and fiscal economies of scale, facilitating defensive investments at the border that protected the interior while limiting free-riding and resource misallocation. Using a new dataset on fortifications in over 6000 European cities, we find that states made defensive investments in areas of territorial contestation, closer to borders, and farther from raw building materials. These findings are consistent with the theory that large centralized states arose in part as a consequence of changes in military technology.

**Home Front Experience and Women's Political Activism**

with Elisabeth Perlman

We leverage novel, hand-collected archival data on women's home front volunteering during the American Civil War to demonstrate the link between wartime and peacetime political capacity. Towns that had volunteer organizations for women in support of the Union war effort were more likely to have women-led political movements to agitate for temperance during the 1870s. This relationship is robust to adjusting for other measures of pre-war and wartime social and organizational capital, including men's enlistment in the Civil War. We argue that wartime mobilization can help women gain organizing experience that can be applied to politics even in contexts that do not involve women directly substituting for men's roles (as they did during the first and second World Wars) and in contexts that predate or preclude most roles for women in the public sphere.

**Export Bans and Volatility Expectations in Grain Markets**

with Michael K. Adjemian and and Michel A. Robe

We document that forward-looking grain price uncertainty is boosted by export bans in key producer countries. We measure market uncertainty via option-implied volatilities (IVs). We hand-construct a detailed, daily dataset of all major export restrictions on wheat, corn, and soybeans between 2001 and 2016. We use this granular, country-level information to show that grain IVs are significantly higher on the day and week when a ban is first imposed and also during the whole period when the ban is in effect. Bans’ impacts are statistically and economically significant, with IVs up between 1 and 2 percentage points on the first day of the ban and up almost one half of 1 percentage point during the entire period when it is in effect. Each grain IV is sensitive to export restrictions for that grain and also for other grains. The impact of bans is weaker for soybeans than for corn or wheat. The results hold even when we control for global macroeconomic uncertainty and risk aversion (jointly captured by the VIX), the state of grain inventories (proxied by net costs of carry at the start of the ban), and possible Samuelson (1965) effects. Our results show the importance of taking political risk into account when analyzing forward-looking volatility in U.S. agricultural markets.
