I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Political Economy and Government Program at Harvard University with a focus on political economy and economic history. My research examines how political outcomes affect, and are affected by, technological change and scientific progress. A second strand of my research focuses on mass political movements and popular protests. My work frequently involves the collection of novel historical data for empirical analysis to shed light on topics with contemporary political relevance. 

My research is supported by a Stone PhD Scholarship in Inequality and Wealth Concentration. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a MSc in Economic History from the London School of Economics and Political Science, and a BS in Mathematics and Economics from American University in Washington, DC.
